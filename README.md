# Frontend Study Guide

## Description

The Frontend Study Guide is created based on the Prework Study Guide for the edX Frontend Developer bootcamp. It aims to contain more detailed notes for HTML, CSS and JS and will be updated as I gain more knowledge about them. 

The purpose of building this guide was to easily find the most important points about the topics while learning. 

This guide is created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Visual Studio Code while using Github to update and maintain versions of code on the Git repository.
