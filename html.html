    <h1><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr></h1>
    <p><i>Note: This page is written entirely in HTML. There is no styling here.</i></p>
    <p><i>Hover over the page heading. You can see the full form of the acronym in the tooltip. This is how the abbr tag works.</i></p>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p><dfn>HTML</dfn> stands for <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language. </strong>It describes the structure of web pages.</p>
    <p><i> HTML in the above sentence is italicised because it is within the dfn tag which is used to refer to the first instance of a definition.</i></p>
    <h2>Head and Body</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Head : This section contains the meta data of a web page. This is information about the page, not displayed on the page. The title can be visible on the tab.</li>
        <li>Body: This is the main structure of the page that is visible to the user.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Elements and Tags</h2>
    <p> HTML comprises of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content so that we can format the page just like we do a word document. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Tags</dt>
        <dd>Tags are used to mark up content on a webpage. They define the structure and meaning of the content they enclose. For example: 
            <code>&ltp&gt</code>
            <p><i>The p tag above is diplayed within the code tag by <a href="https://mateam.net/html-escape-characters/">escaping characters in HTML.</a>Note that the link is an a tag with attribute href pointing to the url.</i></p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Elements</dt>
        <dd>The opening tag, closing tag and the content within them are together called HTML elements. <br> For example, 
            <code>
                &ltp&gt This list is created using definition list, dl with dt for definition term and dd for definition &lt/p&gt
            </code>
        </dd>
        <dt>Attributes</dt>
        <dd>Attributes are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element or to provide additional information that cannot be conveyed through the element's content alone. <br>
            <ul>
                <li> href in a tag</li>
                <li> src in img tag</li>
                <li> alt in img tag</li>
                <li>style attribute</li>
                <li>lang attribute</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>The Main Tags</h2>
    <h3>Heading h1 to h6</h3>
    <p><i>HTML has 6 heading tags from h1 to h6. h1 to h3 have been used above. See below for the remaining.</i></p>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    
    <h3>Paragprah - p</h3>
    <p>Text up to now, is displayed in paragraphs using the p tag. </p>
    <p>By default, p tag displays content in new line with space between subsequent p tag content.</p>

    The table below is created using the table tag. It shows a few HTML tags. Refer the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">W3 schools list</a> for a full list of tags.

    <h2>Structural vs Semantic Markup</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://medium.com/@jastikka.p03/structural-markup-and-semantic-markup-6451966b574d#:~:text=Structural%20markup%20is%20used%20to,the%20content%20within%20those%20structures.">Structural markup is used to define the hierarchical structure of a document, but it does not provide any information about the meaning or purpose of the content within those structures.<br> Semantic markup, on the other hand, is the use of HTML tags that convey meaning and context to the content within those structures. </blockquote>
    <p><i>&nbsp &nbsp The above definitions are within the <q>blockquote</q> tags. They are used for long quotes that take up entire paragraphs. The <q>q</q> tag on the other hand, is used for small quotes and browsers put them in double quotation marks. </i></p>
        
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/html-tag.png" title="title for tooltip" height="300px" alt="image of html tag">
        <figcaption>Example image in png</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul><b>Some points to consider</b>
        <li>
            <ul>select the right format - 
                <li>png for flat color(large area of image filled with exacltly the same color) image like logos and diagrams</li>
                <li>jpeg for images with multiple colors. <i>Note that images with sky, snow, etc. are actually made of different shades although they look like 1 -2 colors. So use jpeg for these.</i></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Select image of right size, dimensions in pixels and not in cm or in.
        </li>
        <li>Provide an accurate alt attribute description. If image is only for decorative purposes, still provide alt attr with empty quotes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Form</h2>
    <p>Forms are important HTML elements that are used to collect information from users. An HTML form constitutes various form controls to gather different types of data from the user.</p>
    <p>The name of the form control and the value entered by the visitor are sent to the server.</p>
